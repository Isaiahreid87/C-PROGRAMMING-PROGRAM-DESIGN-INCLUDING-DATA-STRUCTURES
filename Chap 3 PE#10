/*
Interest on a credit cardâ€™s unpaid balance is calculated using the average daily
balance. Suppose that netBalance is the balance shown in the bill, payment is
the payment made, d1 is the number of days in the billing cycle, and d2
is the number of days payment is made before billing cycle. Then, the
average daily balance is:
averageDailyBalance = (netBalance * d1 - payment * d2)/d1
If the interest rate per month is, say, 0.0152, then the interest on the
unpaid balance is:
interest = averageDailyBalance * 0.0152
Write a program that accepts as input netBalance, payment, d1, d2, and interest
rate per month. The program outputs the interest. Format your output to two
decimal places.
