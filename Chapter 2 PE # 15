/* To make a profit, a local store marks up the prices of its items by a certain
percentage. Write a C++ program that reads the original price of the item sold,
the percentage of the marked-up price, and the sales tax rate. The program then
outputs the original price of the item, the percentage of the mark-up, the storeâ€™s
selling price of the item, the sales tax rate, the sales tax, and the final price of the
item. (The final price of the item is the selling price plus the sales tax.) */
